# Recap

1. Binary search is a lot faster than simple search.
2. O(log n) is faster than O(n), but it gets a lot faster once the list of
items you’re searching through grows.
3. Algorithm speed isn’t measured in seconds.
4. Algorithm times are measured in terms of growth of an algorithm.
5. Algorithm times are written in Big O notation.
